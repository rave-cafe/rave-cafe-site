        On 12.11.21 we hosted a high-fidelity listening party in L&D's basement.

       Zim,
        Fine Touch,
        L B33
        and
        Devoye
        played a selection of music ranging from ambient, jazz, and a cappella
        to spaced-out house and techno.

        & Aileen brought two Ojas hi-fi speakers, and a QSC speaker to create an
        immersive three-point listening experience. They also rigged a custom
        LED ceiling light installation, and vibed out the rest of the apartment
        with silver iridescent fabric and pink and orange light.

        We
        decided to make the basement a no-talking zone where guests could sit or
        lie on the floor, snuggle up in blankets and experience active
        listening. We sought to create an environment where listeners were given
        permission to be left alone to observe and just be, as well as a space
        where each DJ was encouraged to experiment and express themself in
        unexpected ways.

        We provided sheets of paper and blue ink pens and invited guests to
        sketch “a friend, a plant, whatever,” and tape their drawings up on a
        blank wall. I was curious what images the environment would inspire and
        particularly interested in seeing how blue ink would interact with the
        changing lights.

        We wanted to include a livestream element, but felt it was important for
        guests to be able to fully relax without feeling like they were
        on-camera; so we angled the webcam into a mirror tilted up towards the
        light installation. This resulted in a more abstract image of the space,
        silhouetting the DJ and any bodies moving through the space. We also
        placed the computer running the stream behind a curtain in the back of
        the DJ booth so that each DJ could pop in and engage with the chat as
        they wished, without creating any light pollution.

        I was struck by how beautifully and accurately some of the sketches
        captured the spirit of the event. Notably,

        portrayal of the end of the night, when the chill out zone became a
        dance floor. This has left questions in my mind around the different
        ways in which we might be able to document the dance music scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you capture the vibe of a dance floor if the very presence of a
        camera ruins it? Is documentation even necessary? Is the experience of
        dance one that is inherently ephemeral? Do anecdotes and the music
        itself suffice?
