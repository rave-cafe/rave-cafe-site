        On 07.27.21 we hosted a non-dance party at Joe & Dalton’s beloved loft
        space in Bushwick. The event was also streamed on Twitch.

        created a vibe that ranged from ambient, downtempo & drone, to floaty
        house and techno.

        brought a slice of the Karlala Soundsystem to create small, distinct
        points of sound around the space. Pia Coconut generally hid in Joe’s
        room.

        It was late summer 2021, vaccines were a thing, and NYC had exploded
        back to life with myriad dance parties and raves. For us, it was a time
        of great beauty; vibrant, chaotic uncertainty allowed for deep presence
        and the promise of pure potentiality. With this event, rather than aim
        for volume or longevity, we sought to provide a temporary space where
        our friends could relax, reflect, and gather in a meaningful way outside
        of a dance floor.
        </p>
        <img
        src="https://ravecafe.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/color-potential/000310000007.jpg"
        alt="party vibes"
        width="100%"
        />
        <p>
        We wanted to provide an activity for guests to participate in, and I had
        been researching ways to create natural dyes, using sustainability and
        non-toxicity as guiding principles and creative limitations. So we
        ordered a batch of custom t-shirts with the upside down smiley printed
        on the front, and spent about two weeks researching and testing various
        plant-based substances including turmeric, cabbage, avocado pits,
        blueberries and blackberries.
        </p>
        <div class="center"></div>
        <div class="center">
        <img
            class="small-img"
            src="https://ravecafe.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/color-potential/Scan 9.jpeg"
            alt="party vibes"
            width="100%"
        />
        </div>
        <p>
        In the end, only the turmeric ended up sticking to the shirts. The
        cabbage and avocado dye spoiled before the event even started, and the
        berries washed out with the first rinse. However, I realized that it was
        never about the final product anyways. Rather, it was about those four
        delightful hours on a Tuesday afternoon, where a group of friends
        gathered around a table to eat curry, listen to music, and play around
        with the color potential of plants.

            It is forming before our very eyes. <br /><br />Organically, and
            through enough different minds that it’s only a matter of time and
            patience until we see what she has the potential to become.
            <br /><br />
            And even then… she will be still and only ever catapulting forward
            into the next. Or fissuring and falling to the wayside.
            <br /><br />A collection of 60 shirts, faintly tinged with turmeric.
