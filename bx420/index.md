Yoooo friends, family, and Cafe Ravers!

We come bearing good news, the beloved 420 Party turned Spring Celebration returns with an extra serving of psychedelia and sensory stimulation!

When: 4/20/2024 from 3PM - til we're done

RSVP w/ you and your guest's names to [hey@rave.cafe](mailto:hey@rave.cafe) for location details

This year's festivities are in collaboration with Rave Cafe and we will be fundraising for the Resistance themed issue No. 3 of the Rave Cafe Zine.

For those familiar and unfamiliar, this is a gathering of community, friendship and autonomy.  An environment curated to enable honesty with self and others.  Anything goes, so long as it causes no harm to others.  Express yourself, don't wreck yourself.

New for this year, we will be returning to a modified multi-room setup from 2017.  We're extra excited to be having Cy X bring their Pleasure Ceremony experience and additional surprises facilitated by friends and fam.  For the nature lovers, the backyard will also be accessible [should nature allow.]  We'll have a Roll Your Own tutorial at 4:20pm led by DJ Yerba Mate alongside a doobie photo booth.

Space Activation by Cy X, L&D, Ziggy and Adam.

As usual, a delicious spread of food will be served and those who arrive early will be rewarded for their efforts.  If anyone would like to contribute a food offering, they're welcome to but should contact us first.

This is a BYO event.  The bar is a community pool. If you want a personal stash, keep it on your person.   There will be an offering of chasers, simple beverages, and trippy stuff [while supplies last.]

Remember to bring house shoes/slippers to wear inside the home.

And most importantly! The Sound Room is being helmed by a crew of trusted selectors ready to keep us jamming into the morning.  But like all Rave Cafe happenings #BringYourUSB because you never know what might go down:
