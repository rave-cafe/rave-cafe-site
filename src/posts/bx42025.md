## menu 004 funds

we are currently fundraising for the fourth and final zine in the rave cafe menu series. If you have the means, please consider a donation!

[Donate via venmo - @elleb33](https://venmo.com/u/elleb33)

this zineâ€™s theme is DIY through the lens of degrowth. how can we rethink how we engage with exploitative systems, such as capitalism? how can we organize together within (and beyond) the ecosystem of our dance music community to imagine, create & support parallel systems that better serve people and the planet? how can we find joy in this work?
