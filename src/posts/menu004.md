Thank you for scanning the QR code on the back.

This zine is the fourth & final in the menu series. It is the collective work of over 60 artists, authors, activists and aliens. All contributions were made and submitted separately. Below is a selection of the entries from the zine. Please check out the artists and support $$ their work!

We were able to print 4,000 copies of menu 004 --- twice as many as last year --- due to the support of friends and the generous $$ contributions from 56+ benefactors.

THANK YOU to everyone who opened their homes, shared their club nights, played at our fundraising events, threw cash in a turquoise pumpkin, or otherwise pitched in to reach our fundraising goal.

While this is the final zine in this series, we believe in the power of printed media so please keep your eyes open for future printed matter.

Inspired by the paranormal practice of "remote viewing," in which practitioners claim the ability to mentally perceive distant subjects and places, Brooklyn-based artist Janus Rose meditates on our technology-mediated observation of state violence and genocide. Utilizing procedurally generated graphics, this first piece in the series dynamically tracks objects through a series of virtual cameras, assigning objects names pulled in real-time from a public dataset[1] of Palestinians killed by occupation forces in Gaza.

W/ director M Woods in person

259 Green Street, Brooklyn

MAY 30 | 7PM

M. Woods (He/Him/They/Them) is a multidisciplinary artist implementing avant-garde strategies under the studio name “Disassociative Productions”. M is a first-generation US citizen, born to a Costa-Rican/Ecuadorian mother. M uses immersive time-based spectacle and constructed trances to navigate the internalized socio-political topographies of addiction, mental and physical disability, malignant nihilism, and white supremacy. M’s work deconstructs the post-911 acceleration of hyperrealism and (media)drug dependency, documenting the spread of solipsism in a media environment dominated by corporate neo-fascism.
