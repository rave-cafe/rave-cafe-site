## why?

Web support is about making a simple web site to break out of being locked into only using platforms others control. The web was designed around open protocols to be decentralized & collaborative.

The web as we know it today was designed to share science papers between universities. In 1989 Sir Tim Berners Lee developed HTML - hypertext markup language - which is what the letters you're reading right now are encoded in and HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol - which is how the HTML got to your computer. He also developed the URL - uniform resource locater - which routes the HTML to the right place using words you can remember like [rave.cafe](http://rave.cafe). URLs were built on top of a US DoD technology from the 70's called TCP/IP - transfer control protocol / internet protocol - which was designed to reliably transfer packages of information over computer networks to your IP address.

We'll be building a website together over the course of three weeks.
